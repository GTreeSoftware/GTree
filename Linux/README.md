### Note
GTree Linux and Windows version are individual due to the difference usage of crossplatform libraries. There may be some 
difference between the code on different platform. Main function is OK.

Instruction files are in root directory of github.

### Libraries

If you use Ubuntu Linux 16.04 GCC 5.4, We can send you pre-built 3rd libraries.

### Seek for Community help

Neurons are so complicated that we cannot consider all situation. Bug and lack of functionality in GTree is unavoidable. Please let us know the bugs you find or new function you want. If you know some powerful neuron analysis algorithm which can be integrated in GTree, please tell us thanks.

### A show time video is preparing

We will show you the operation fluency of GTree.

### Some known bugs

1. Right-click and GUI window will show context menu. It's all right in Windows but failed in Linux. I have to over-write right-click function in vtk interactorstyle.
2. When in move-point mode, GTree-Linux cannot pop up context menu. Just press short-cut 'M' to toggle move-point mode. It's all right in windows.
3. GTree file should have excutable permission in Linux, or cannot be excuted.
